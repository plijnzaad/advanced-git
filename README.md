# Data

The current repository contains some data (`hsf1.type.txt`) and some
simple R code (`hsf1.R1`) to help visualize this data, just for
playing. Feel free to use your own data and/or scripts for this.  The
data is from de Jonge et al., EMBO J. 2016, and describes the decrease
in gene expression (M, which is the log2-ratio of expression change
relative to wild-type yeast) upon conditional deletion of the
transcription factor Hsf1, the upstream binding of which is given in the
'binding' column. The type of promoter (SAGA: stress response genes;
TFIID: housekeeping genes) is given in the last column)
